# GitHub activity repositories

Throughout Besut Kode Universitas, participants must remain active on GitHub
in repositories listed here during the elimination month.

Your GitHub activity must be high quality, positive contributions.

If you are a committer of a repository that qualifies,
you may use that repository to remain active.

The list will change throughout the elimination month.

The list of acceptable repositories is:

-  22 October: The GitHub Pages repositories of **other**
   [**participants**](https://besutkode.github.io/peserta-universitas.html)
   using Pull Requests.

-  25 October: The GitHub repositories listed on
   [**Awesome Indonesia Repo**](https://github.com/GitIndonesia/awesome-indonesia-repo),
   excluding repositories that are only lists.
   You may submit a request to add an eligible repository to that awesome list.
   See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/GitIndonesia/awesome-indonesia-repo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).  However, the request does not count as a contribution activity. If it is not accepted, the repository is not eligible.  Join
   [gitter.im/GitIndonesia/awesome-indonesia-repo](https://gitter.im/GitIndonesia/awesome-indonesia-repo)
   or [Facebook group GitHubID](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GitHubID/) to
   discuss adding new entries.

-  28 October: A **blog post** on your own GitHub Pages.

-  31 October: Any repository **without a license**. Create an issue on the repo explaining why it should have a license and what license it should adopt. See [this example](https://github.com/endymuhardin/buku-git/issues/5).

-  3 November: Any [**open data**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) repository **with a license**. See 
[Awesome Public Datasets](http://awesomelists.top/#/repos/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) for some examples. You may add a license to an open data repo if it doesn't have one, but it **does not** count as a contribution activity, and it **must** be merged before the deadline.

-  6 November: Any repository in [**github.com/translate**](https://github.com/translate) or [**github.com/languagetool-org**](https://github.com/languagetool-org).

-  9 November: Another **blog post** on your own GitHub Pages.

-  12-20 November: Any GitHub repository owned by any [**GSOC mentoring organisation**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/).
