        Submit your edit as a Pull Request on the
        [BesutKode.github.io](https://github.com/BesutKode/BesutKode.github.io) repository.

        Within 24 hours, Wikimedia Indonesia staff will check the Pull Request,
        and then either accept or reject and close it.
        If your first pull request is rejected, you may resubmit a second pull request.
        If your second pull request is rejected, you are ineligible to partipate in Besut Kode.

    When the pull request is merged, the participant will be sent an email containing an example
    Besut Kode task, which will not be used in the elimination round.
    Participants may use [this example task](https://wikimedia-id.github.io/besutkode/university-sample-task-1-en.html)
    to prepare for the elimination round.

0.  Elimination round (Oct 20 - Nov 20)

    The elimination round consists of five tasks, performed consecutively, including tasks that will
    prepare the participant for working effectively on an open source project, as is required for GSOC projects:
    documentation, research and programming.

    Each participant who successfully entered the program will be sent their first task on 20 October 00:01
    via email.

    An automated process will check for regular Github activity of each participant.
    Participants must have activity on Github for each 72 hour block of time from
    starting from 20 Oct 00:01, to a respository in
    [the list of acceptable repositories](http://wikimedia-id.github.io/besutkode/university-activity-repositories-en.html).

    In addition to the five tasks, each participant must have three badges on their
    Stackoverflow account at the end of this round.

    The task emails will contain precise instructions for completing the task, and assessment criteria.

    After completing each task, another task will automatically be sent via email
    within 24 hrs.

    At the end of this round, successful participants will have done the following tasks *during* this round:

    - Contributed to bahasa Indonesia Wikipedia.
    - Collaborated on a popular Github project.
    - Answered a Project Euler problem of 50% difficulty.
    - Improved the Continuous Integration of a project on GitHub.
    - Used static code analysis tools to find problems with code.

    Everyone who has completed all of the tasks and other requirements of the
    elimination round will receive a certificate of competency.

    However only 60 students will continue past this elimination round.

    If more than 60 students complete all of the tasks, the mentors will select
    the best 60 based on their activity on Github and Stackoverflow.

0.  Challenge mentoring (Nov 21 to Dec 20)

    One generic challenge will be sent out to all participants on Nov 21, and all
    participants will be invited to join a WhatsApp group and IRC channel to
    collaborate together.

    The challenge theme and activity will be exactly the same for all participants,
    however each participant will have their own solution for this task.
    Each participant will be able to choose from a wide selection of programming
    languages to complete the challenge.

    During this period, workshops will be held where participants and mentors can
    collaborate on how to solve the challenge.

    Mentors will review the solutions, and provide feedback to each student.

0.  Challenge coding continues (Dec 20 - January 20)

    The participants continue working on their challenge solution without mentor
    assistance.

    The participants must submit pull requests to their chosen Github project,
    and their changes must be merged by January 20.

# Winners

Mentors will evaluate the solutions and select the best 5.

On 10 February the winners will be announced.

The first and second prize is a laptop and trip to FOSSASIA 2017 in Singapore in March.

The top five will all be given a 3 day intensive workshop in Jakarta, where they will be assisted to prepare
their GSOC application.

Two of the best five will be offered an 3-month internship at Wikimedia Indonesia.
