Happy New Year 2017! 

To the participants of Besut Kode High School, the year 2017 will start as a new challenge for them as they are competing to be on the top for international programming competitions [Google Code-in](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/). 

## What is Google Code-in? 

To find out more about the Google Code-in we suggest you watch our video, an interview of "what is google code-in" 
by Google Code-in 2014 winner from Indonesia, Tasya Rukmana.

For all Google Code-in competition there's always three parties in it<br>
1. Dozens of organizations setting up an a platform where mentor volunteer to provide tasks to be done by high school participants aged 13-17 years<br>
2. Thousands of participants who do tasks online from all over the world<br>
3. Google as the organizers are providing grand prize, gifts, certificates, and compiling registration<br>

The open source organizations participating in Google Code-in competition varied in number each year. 

In 2016, there were [17 organizations participating in the Google Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations/), it means that every organization is entitled to determine three to five finalists and come out with one winner's name.

One winner from 17 organizations will receive a trip to Google head quarter in San Francisco, United States to meet with the other winner. This means google will fund a total of 17 winners from each organization to go to the United States, in addition, each organization will also publish the names of the finalists, which was considered "almost won". 

Besut Kode high school's mentor already warn the Besut Kode participants that winning will be difficult, many of Google Code-in participant is an alumni from the previous year, who already know the knicks and knack of the competiton and know the mentors. The Besut Kode participants are welcome to learn as much as possible and do the job as well as they could with the goal of, at least, made it to the list of finalists. The reason are this list of finalists is registered and recognized by the organizations participating in the Google Code-in and can be used as references for future participants, the list of finalists also separates the participants deemed by the mentor already work really hard and have potential with the other participants is considered "merely" participating.

## Leader Board
Google Code-in 2016 began in November and will end in mid-January 2017. Leader Board are term introduced in the competition featuring a list of participants in excel compares to other participants. The list from the leader board may or may not necessarily end up as finalist, but this list is useful to see the participants who have struggled from week to week to complete tasks and overcome new challenges as the composition of the name is often changed according to their contribution in the competition.
